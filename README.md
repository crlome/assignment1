•	Stick to ReactJS and Javascript for developing the solution – avoid additional frameworks and Typescript.
•	Follow the Principal of Class Component or Functional Component (On the basis of Need)
•	Use State Full mechanism for data binding
•	Data Fetching and Insertion should use Async call 
•	Clear and Concise , Readable code
•	No hardcoded / magic numbers. Use constant definitions/dynamic props
•	Async call should be used for data access. 
•	Create Class based components./ use React components to generate the UI elements 
•	 UI needs to be reasonably OK.  Not expecting a fancy UI.
•	Binary Files should not be checked [shouldn’t be any for JS , but yes no class files. As a standard rule any artifact that can be built should not be version controlled in github


Assignment
Homework Problem:
A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
 
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
 
Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.
